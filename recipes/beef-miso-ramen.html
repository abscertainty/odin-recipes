    <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
        <li>Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
