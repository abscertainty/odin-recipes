A simple HTML project that will help me learn how to 
craft better commit messages. As for the HTML part, I 
probably won't be learning much but I will come back
to add notes at the end of the project.

As mentioned before, the HTML in this project was really
basic, but I tried to be as efficient as possible with
my commits as well as the messages contained in each of them.

Over all this project taught me mostly about git commits.
